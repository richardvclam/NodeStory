# NodeStory - MapleStory server emulator for Node.js

**Work in progress!**

NodeStory is a MapleStory server emulator for the Node.js runtime. This is a hobby project to challenge myself as a backend developer and build upon my understanding of TypeScript and Node.js.

NodeStory will be taking a modern and SOLID approach for its architecture. My focus will be writing a maintainable server framework that allow developers to easily modify and extend functionalities.

## Goals

- Create a "core" package

## Tech Stack

- Node.js v12+
- TypeScript
- MongoDB

## Credits

- Wizet/Nexon are the owners of MapleStory and all respective intellectual property.
- diamondo25 for his Maple.js implementation and inspiration.
